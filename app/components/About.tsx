          From Maguindanao, Philippines – I aspire to become a top-notch software engineer and an influential writer. 
          I recently finished my Higher Diploma in Software Engineering at Lithan Academy, Singapore, 
          and am currently enrolled for BSc (Hons) Computer Science at Roehampton University, United  Kingdom, 
          to further my studies and competencies.

        <p className='mt-4 about-paragraph'>
          Got 2 years of experience in the industry – as a software developer @Smmile, 
          Singapore. Just recently graduated? Yeah,
          I just do it while studying to have practical applications for my learning. 
          I enjoyed working on backend development because I like discussing Algorithms and System Architecture.
          About frontend – can work too especially in considering the user experience of an application. 
          The boom of AI gets my interest too — if I have  a chance to work with it, then I gladly accept without second thought.
